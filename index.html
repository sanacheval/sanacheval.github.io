        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a 23 year old software developer with a knack for problem solving.
            I was born in America and raised in Karachi, Pakistan.
            I lived in Montréal for four years for university and have since moved back home. 
            I discovered coding and software development during university and promptly switched majors from Mathematics to Computer Science. 
            It felt like the perfect application of maths which was already a subject I had loved for years.
            The concept of there being one correct answer always made sense to me and I have always been determined to find that answer when a problem is presented.
            I have also always been creative and grew up believing I would one day become an artist.</p>

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <h4>CPU in Logisim Evolution</h4>
        <p>In a class focused on CPUs and Computer Systems, the final project was to build a CPU in a software called Logisim Evolution. The software allows you to simulate digital circuits. The CPU I built was capable of writing data to the RAM, adding and subtracting registers from each other.  </p>
        <h4>Operating System in C</h4>
        <p>I took a class focused on Operating Systems. As we learnt how they work, we simultaneously coded one as our class project. I was provided with a basic starter shell on which I built a running operating system in C. It has a scheduling infrastructure that runs in First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First with Job Ageing  (SJF) and Round Robin (RR). The scheduler was multithreaded. Finally I built a paging infrastructure where I set up a backing store which would then load scripts to the frame memory when they were called to run. </p>
        <h4>Search Engine in Java</h4>
        <p>The final project of a class focused on understanding Java was to build a search engine. The engine sorts through a provided database. I implemented crawling and indexing where the engine collected information from web pages (simulated by given databases), then ranked these results by how relevant they were (using a formula provided to calculate this) and finally gave the results of the search. </p>

        <h4>Simplified Scrabble in Python</h4>
        <p>In order to create a simplified scrabble game, I created many smaller functions including ones to create a blank board, display the board, check what fits on the board, check for valid words (using a provided database) and finally computed scores to see who won.</p>

        <h4>Analysis of land for Ski Resort in ArcGIS Pro</h4></span>
        <p>In a class focused on ArcGIS Pro and Geospatial Data Analysis, the final project was assessing an area for the building of a Ski Resort. Using ArcGIS Pro I analyzed the area given to check for the total snowfall, distance from roads, slope percentage, distance from protected areas, number of amenities and inhabitants at site. Using this information I drafted a report showing which location seemed most ideal according to guidelines provided to us, and providing digital maps of the data I collected. </p>
