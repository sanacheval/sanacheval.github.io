        <h3>about me</h3>
        <p>I am a 23 year old software developer with a knack for problem solving.
            I was born in America and raised in Karachi, Pakistan.
            I lived in Montréal for four years for university and have since moved back home. 
            I discovered coding and software development during university and promptly switched majors from Mathematics to Computer Science. 
            It felt like the perfect application of maths which was already a subject I had loved for years.
            The concept of there being one correct answer always made sense to me and I have always been determined to find that answer when a problem is presented.
            I have also always been creative and grew up believing I would one day become an artist.</p>

        <h4>CPU in Logisim Evolution</h4>
        <p>Logisim evolution is an application I discovered taking a class on CPU's. After understanding how they run it was exciting to put together a real working CPU (albeit a very simple one). </p>
        <h4>Operating System in C</h4>
        <p>Provided with some starter code, we built simple operating systems in C. They had interpreters..</p>
        <h4>Search Engine in Java</h4>
        <h4>Simplified Scrabble in Python</h4>
